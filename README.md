# Intrusion Detection System using Layered Machine Learning

An advanced **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** developed using a **layered machine learning architecture** combining **Decision Trees**, **K-Nearest Neighbors**, and **Neural Networks** to efficiently detect and classify network intrusions with improved accuracy.

> ðŸš€ Improved threat detection accuracy by **20%** and reduced false positives by **15%** compared to baseline models.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project presents a **multi-layered intrusion detection system** that leverages the strengths of multiple machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic data and accurately classify threats. It is implemented using **Python** and is trained and tested on benchmark intrusion datasets.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

The layered system architecture uses the following ML techniques:

- **Layer 1: Decision Tree Classifier**
  - Filters benign and obvious malicious traffic
- **Layer 2: K-Nearest Neighbors**
  - Performs similarity-based classification for medium-risk flows
- **Layer 3: Neural Networks**
  - Detects sophisticated and stealthy intrusion patterns

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Achievements

- ðŸš« **False Positives Reduced by 15%**
- âœ… **Accuracy Improved by 20%**
- âš¡ **Layered processing** enhances scalability and precision
- ðŸ§ª Trained and evaluated on real-world network datasets
